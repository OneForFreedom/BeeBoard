Entry 1:

OOOOH new project! I'm gonna start with scematics, but it's late already. I'll get to it tomorrow. Parts research was a pain, restarted 10 times when I realised shipping was too much.

TIME SPENT: 7H 9 MIN

PROJECT COMPLETE!!

Okay! So here's what I did today! I researched the parts, completed the schematic, pcb and cad, and coded the firmware. This took almost the entire day but I'm proud of it
