I'm tired.
PROJECT COMPLETE!!

Okay! So here's what I did today! I researched the parts, completed the schematic, pcb and cad, and coded the firmware. This took almost the entire day but I'm proud of it

All images will be found in /Images and also in Readme.md 

Boms can be found in BOM.csv or Readme.md

Thanks for being in this little adventure with me. 
One For Freedom, Buzzing away!
Until parts arrive :P
